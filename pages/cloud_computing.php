                                                   is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are centrally hosted on the cloud.

                                                <p>
                                                    SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications.

                                            Platform as a service (PaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a computing platform 
                                            and a solution stack as a service.

                                            In this model, the consumer creates the software using tools and/or libraries from the provider.

                                            Infrastructure as a Service is a provision model in which an organization outsources 
                                            the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware, servers and networking components.

                                            The service provider owns the equipment and is responsible for housing, running and maintaining it. The client typically pays on a per-use basis.

                            <p><strong class="quote">â€œ</strong>A chance to blot our mistakes and change failure into winning. It does not take a special time to make a brand new start. It only takes the deep desire to try with all our heart. To live a little better, to always be forgiving. To add a little sunshine in a world for which were living. Never give up in despair Nor think you are through. For theres always a tomorrow, a chance to start new.</p>
